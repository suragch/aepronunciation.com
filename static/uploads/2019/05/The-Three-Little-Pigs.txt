Once upon a time, there were three little pigs. They said goodbye to their mother and went out to make their own homes. The first little pig made his house out of straw. The second little pig made his house out of sticks. The third little pig made his house out of bricks. There was a big bad wolf. The big bad wolf was very hungry. He went to the first little pig with the straw house and knocked on the door. Little pig, little pig, open the door!
