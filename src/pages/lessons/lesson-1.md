# Lesson 1 - Introduction to IPA, American and British English

## Introduction

In linguistics a language sound is called a [phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme). The study of all of these sounds are called [phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics). In this first lesson we will look at the sounds of American English.

Everyone knows the 26 letters of the English alphabet:

> a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

However, these letters have a problem. You can't use them to write how words really sound because they all have multiple pronunciations.

Take "a", for example. Here are just a few examples of words that use "a", but in each one the "a" has a different sound:

- take
- cap
- father

The same thing for "b". In the second word "comb" the "b" is completely silent.
- boat
- comb

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/1-2.mp3" />

And for "c":
- **c**at
- **c**ell
- **c**hild
- ma**c**hine

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/1-3.mp3" />

In fact, every single one of the 26 letters can be pronounced in more than one way. That makes a problem when you hear a word and you want to write down how it is pronounced. [Here is an example](https://ielanguages.com/phonetics.html) of different letter combinations that all have the ee of meet sound:

- h**e**
- bel**ie**ve
- L**ee**
- C**ae**sar
- k**ey**
- am**oe**ba
- loudl**y**
- mach**i**ne
- p**eo**ple
- s**ea**

Here is a poem that makes a joke of English spelling and pronunciation:

> I take it you already **know** of **tough** and **bough** and **cough** and **dough**?  
> Some may stumble, but not **you**, on **hiccough**, **thorough**, **slough**, and **through**?  
> So now you are ready, perhaps, to learn of less familiar traps?  
> Beware of **heard**, a dreadful **word**, that looks like **beard**, but sounds like **bird**.  
> And **dead**, it's **said** like **bed**, not **bead**; for goodness' sake, don't call it **deed**!  
> Watch out for **meat** and **great** and **threat**.  
> (They rhyme with **suite** and **straight** and **debt**.)  
> A **moth** is not a moth in **mother**, nor **both** in **bother**, **broth** in **brother**.  
> And **here** is not a match for **there**, nor **dear** and **fear**, for **bear** and **pear**.  
> And then there's **dose** and **rose** and **lose** - just look them up - and **goose** and **choose**  
> And **cork** and **work** and **card** and **ward** and **font** and **front** and **word** and **sword**  
> And **do** and **go**, then **thwart** and **cart**, come, come! I've hardly made a start.  
> A dreadful language? Man alive! I'd mastered it when I was five.

So if the English alphabet can't be used to reliably write the sounds of a word, what is the solution? Use another alphabet?

- Кирилл
- 中文
- 한국어
- देवनागरी
- αλφάβητο
- عربى

While some alphabets in the world are better about matching one sound for each letter, there is no alphabet that has enough letters for every sound in the world.

So what is the solution?

## International Phonetic Alphabet

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) was made just for the purpose of writing the sounds of a language. Every IPA symbol has only one pronunciation.

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IPA_chart_2018.pdf) is what the chart looks like:

![IPA Chart](/uploads/2020/03/IPA-2018.jpg)

If you would like to hear what each of those symbols sound like, you can find an interactive chart [here](http://www.ipachart.com/). If you are interested in knowing the IPA symbols used to write the sounds of the following languages, you can click the links below. This list is not complete of course.

- [Mongolian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_language#Phonology)
- [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese_phonology)
- [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_phonology)
- [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_phonology)
- [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology)

You might be overwhelmed by how many IPA symbols there are. The reason there are so many is that they have to cover every single language in the world. Don't worry. We aren't going to learn that many. The symbols used in English are much fewer.

Here are the symbols that we are going to use in this course to write the sounds of American English:

And here are the symbols for British English:

Here is the audio for the vowels. The audio comes from [this website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/features/pronunciation/introduction):

I didn't include the consonants because the consonant sounds for American and British English are mostly the same.

:::note
Some of the symbols used in the charts above for American and British English are not true IPA symbols, but I am using them here because of there common usage in textbooks and dictionaries.

That's all for today's lesson. See you next class.

## Exercise

Copy the symbols for American and British English by hand on paper. Here is an example:
