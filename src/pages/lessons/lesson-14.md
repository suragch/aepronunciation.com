## Pronunciation of Unstressed Words

These are the [10 most common words in English](https://www.rypeapp.com/most-common-english-words/):

1. the
2. of
3. and
4. a
5. to
6. in
7. is
8. you
9. that
10. it

Notice that all of these words are usually unstressed. (The word "that" can be stressed depending on its meaning.)

Vowels in unstressed syllables often change their pronunciation to /ə/ or /ɪ/.

- delicious
- reply
- automatically

Words at the beginning or end of a sentence may be pronounced more clearly:

- Have they come?
- I don't want to.
- I'll give it to you.

When "the" comes before a word that starts with a vowel, it's pronounced /ði/ rather than /ðə/.

- the entrance
- the ant
