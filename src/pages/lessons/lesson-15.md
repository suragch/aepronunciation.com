## Review

1. What kinds of words are usually stressed?
2. What kinds of words are usually unstressed?
3. When do you break the stress rules?

### Practice

Mark the stressed words:

1. July is the hottest month of the year.
2. How long did you go swimming for?
3. These were the events leading up to her birthday celebration.

In the second sentence, how would you give it a better rhythm?

Write the IPA for the third sentence.

## Unstressed words in a sentence

### Stress count

Notice that even though the number of words in the following sentences are different, the number of stressed syllables is the same.

The ˈkids ˈeat ˈice.

The ˈkids are ˈeating some ˈice.  
The ˈkids are ˈeating some ˈice cream.  
The ˈkids are ˈeating some ˈice cream with me.  
The ˈkids will be ˈeating some ˈice cream with me.

### A word of caution

Wanna, gonna, gotta and the others are spoken English and informal written English. You shouldn't use them to write in formal or academic settings. You may see them in informal settings like pop songs, text messages between friends, or movie subtitles.

Be careful of being too informal

'wʌʤjə'du  
'waɪonʔjə'seɪt  
'ʤiʔ'jɛʔ noʊ ʤju  

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/05/15-5.mp3" />

Which means

What did you do?  
Why don't you say it?  
Did you eat yet? No, did you?
