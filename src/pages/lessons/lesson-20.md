## Review

Mark the stress and intonation:

What would you like?

I'd like an apple.

I'd like a cup of coffee.

I'd like to speak to you.

I'd like to see.

I'd like to know.

## Rising Intonation

Simple Yes-No questions use rising intonation in American English.

![rising intonation](/uploads/2020/05/rising_intonation.png)

### Here are some examples:

Have you ever been to Beijing?

Should I answer the telephone?

Can I help you?

May I sit here?

May I sit here?

Is that too much for you to carry in the rain?

Does she expect to take a dictionary with her?

It's at the last stressed syllable that you begin to rise. If there are any unstressed syllables at the end, they are all high.

![rising intonation last stress](/uploads/2020/05/rising_intonation_last_stress.png)

Now you try:

Would you like a sandwich?

Is this your shirt?

After you came home from school did you give it to her?

Didn't you wash the dishes?

Did you reply?

Here is another set with mixed intonation. Some use Rising-Falling Intonation and others use Rising Intonation.

What are you doing?

How about going to lunch with me?

Could you bring me the book?

Would you go to lunch with me?

This book is blue.

This book is blue?

So what time will you call back?

Isn't that the man you saw at the police station?

## Repeated Questions

When you are going?

When am I going?

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/05/20-4.mp3" />

What time is it?

What time is it? It's five o'clock.

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/05/20-5.mp3" />

What's she doing?

What's she doing? Don't you know?
