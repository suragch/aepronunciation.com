Tell me the tones as I say these sentences:

## Rising-Falling Intonation

There is a common pattern in English where the tones go normal-high-low.

This is called Rising-Falling intonation.

There are three main kinds of sentences that use Rising-Falling intonation:
1. Statements
2. Commands
3. Wh-questions

Let's look at some examples of each of these.

### Statements

This is my friend.

I'm leaving tomorrow.

Please close the window.

### Wh-questions

## How to mark Rising Falling intonation

The high tone is usually at the last stressed syllable of the sentence.

### Process

1. Mark all the stressed words

2. The first part of the sentence uses normal intonation.

3. If the last stressed syllable has any unstressed syllables after it, then make the last stressed syllable high and the unstressed syllables low.

4. If the last syllable of the sentence is stressed, then make it high-to-low.

### Practice

I'm going to the store with him.

Get me some paper.

How much do you want?

I want as much as you can carry.

Then give your bag to me.

Then give me your bag.

When will you come back?
