#### Puzzle

Two Doors

There are two doors. Behind one door is a beautiful horse. Behind the other door is a roaring lion. Each door has a guard. One guard always tells the truth. The other guard always lies. What question can you ask so that you open the right door?

## The /ʊr/ sound

I didn't make a video for this sound here or in the ae Pronunciation app because it isn't used that frequently in American English. Some people ask for it though because its British English counterpart /ʊə/ is used in quite a few words.

Here are some words that use /ʊə/ in British English:

poor, pure, cure, tour, assure, sure, lure

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/5-21.mp3" />

However, in American English from the above list only "pure" and "cure" (and for some people "sure") use /ʊr/.

- /ɔr/: poor
- /ur/: tour, lure
- /ɝ/: assure, (sure)
- /ʊr/: pure, cure, (sure)

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/5-22.mp3" />

## Other "R" sounds

You can put the /ɚ/ sound after most any vowel. Here are a few more examples for diphthongs:

| Sound | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| 1. eɪr (eɪɚ) | player, mayor, sayer, layer |
| 2. aɪr (aɪɚ) | lier, fire, crier, hire |
| 3. aʊr (aʊɚ) | tower, power, sour, hour |
| 4. ɔɪr (ɔɪɚ) | lawyer, foyer, Sawyer, boy or girl |
| 5. oʊr (oʊɚ) | mower, sower, blower, lower |
