## Review

Review the American English phonetic chart:

And review the British English vowels:

## Fricatives

You know how your hands get hot when you rub them together?

That's caused by friction.You can also create friction in your mouth by making the air have a hard time getting out.

Fricatives are consonants that let air through with a lot of friction. They don't make your mouth hot, but they do produce a special sound.

## The /f/ and /v/ sounds

Both of these are labiodental sounds. That means you make them by touching the top teeth to the bottom lip and blowing air through. /f/ is voiceless and /v/ is voiced, but the mouth position is the same.
