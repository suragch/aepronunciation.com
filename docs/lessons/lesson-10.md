#### Tongue twister

Betty Botter bought a bit of butter;  
"But," she said, "this butter's bitter!  
If I put it in my batter  
It will make my batter bitter.  
But a bit o' better butter  
Will make my batter better."  
Then she bought a bit o' butter  
Better than the bitter butter,  
Made her bitter batter better.  
So 'twas better Betty Botter  
Bought a bit o' better butter.
