Sea Fever  
John Masefield (1874-1967)

I ˈmust go down to the ˈseas again, to the ˈlonely sea and the ˈsky,  
And ˈall I ask is a ˈtall ship and a ˈstar to steer her ˈby,  
And the ˈwheel's kick and the ˈwind's song and the ˈwhite sail's ˈshaking,  
And a ˈgray mist on the ˈsea's face, and a ˈgray dawn ˈbreaking.  

I ˈmust go down to the ˈseas again, for the ˈcall of the running ˈtide  
Is a ˈwild call and a ˈclear call that ˈmay not be deˈnied;  
And ˈall I ask is a ˈwindy day with the ˈwhite clouds ˈflying,  
And the ˈflung spray and the ˈblown spume, and the ˈsea-gulls ˈcrying.  

I ˈmust go down to the ˈseas again, to the ˈvagrant gypsy ˈlife,  
To the ˈgull's way and the ˈwhale's way, where the ˈwind's like a whetted ˈknife;  
And ˈall I ask is a ˈmerry yarn from a ˈlaughing fellow-ˈrover,  
And ˈquiet sleep and a ˈsweet dream when the ˈlong trick's ˈover.

This recording emphasizes the rhythm slightly more than a natural reading would.

I'll get 'fruit and 'vegetables.
