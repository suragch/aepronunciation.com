## Review

You've already learned about Rising-Falling Intonation:

![rising falling 2](/uploads/2020/05/rising-falling-2.png)

And also Rising Intonation:

![rising intonation](/uploads/2020/05/rising_intonation.png)

For both of these intonation patterns the first part of the sentence used a Normal tone.

## Non-Final Intonation (single thought group)

In this lesson you will see some non-final high tones. These are used to emphasize or stress the important words in a sentence.

What do you know about calculus?

There are lots of people in the train station.

I think that is a good idea.

What do you need a car for?

## Comparison in a single thought group

When you are comparing two things, one gets a high tone and the other gets a very high tone. The choice for which gets the very high tone changes the meaning of the sentence.

My students dance better than I do.

My students dance better than I do.

The black kitten is as cute as the brown one.

The black kitten is as cute as the brown one.
