Sea Fever  
by John Masefield

I ˈmust go down to the ˈseas again, to the ˈlonely sea and the ˈsky,  
And ˈall I ask is a ˈtall ship and a ˈstar to steer her ˈby;  
And the ˈwheel's kick and the ˈwind's song and the ˈwhite sail's ˈshaking,  
And a ˈgrey mist on the ˈsea's face, and a ˈgrey dawn ˈbreaking.
