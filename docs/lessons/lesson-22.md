# Lesson 22 - And/Or series, "or" questions

## Imitation

As you imitate the speech in this story, pay special attention to the non-final intonation.

## Review

As I say the following words, match them to the intonation patterns below:
- want to
- want

![non final](/uploads/2020/05/non-final.png)

Practice reading the following sentences will all three pronunciation patterns. (Note that the "if" clause can't use the finished pattern.)
- A friend of the wise becomes wise; a friend of fools becomes a fool.
- I'd like to, but I'm busy that night.
- If you smile, I'll take your picture.

## "And" Series

When you have three or more things in a list, you separate them with commas and put an "and" before the last one.

Here is an example:
- I like ice cream, chocolate, and pickles.

When you have this type of series, the first items use a rising intonation and the final item uses a falling intonation.

Here it goes normal-to-high for the first items, but it is also common to hear high-to-normal. Both of these mean "unfinished".

It is only at the last item of the series that you have high-low or high-to-low which signifies that the list if finished.
- Let's look at some more examples:
- She can speak English, Chinese, and Mongolian.
- He'd like a hamburger, some french fries, and a Coke.
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!

You can hear this intonation in the game Duck, Duck, Goose:

## "Or" Series

You can get a similar pattern with a list with "or":
- We can eat at McDonald's, KFC, or Pizza Hut.
- You can choose between red, white, brown, or green.

## "Or" Questions

There are two different kinds of "or" questions and many students of English give the wrong answer because they misunderstand the intonation.

Have a look at these apples:

Looking at each one, let's ask the following two questions:

Is the apple red or green?

Is the apple red or green?

Can I smoke or drink on campus?

Can I smoke and drink on campus?

![no smoking and drinking](/uploads/2020/05/no-smoking-and-drinking.jpeg)

Here are some more. Chose the best intonation.
- Do you prefer pop music or classical music?
- In the winter do you like to skate or ski?
- Will you have coffee or tea?
- Have you ever played volleyball or basketball?
- Is the traffic light red or green?
- Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
