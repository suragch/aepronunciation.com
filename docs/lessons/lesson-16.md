## Review

Listen to the difference between voiced and voiceless consonants:
- ɑt    ɑd
- ip    ib
- oʊk    oʊg
- _t     _d
- _p    _b
- _k    _g

What are the stress rules?  
What if you have two nouns together? Which one is stressed?  
What if you have a two-word verb? Which one is stressed?  
When do you break the stress rules?

## Homework

Here is the dialog with the words marked according to the stressed rules:

ˈGood ˈmorning, ˈSusan. ˈWhere are you ˈgoing?  
ˈHi, ˈMrs. ˈJones! I'm ˈgoing to the ˈstore.  
I ˈneed to ˈgo, ˈtoo. ˈLet's ˈgo toˈgether.  
ˈSounds ˈgood. Are you ˈbuying ˈfood?  
ˈYes. I ˈwant to ˈget ˈsomething ˈhealthy for my ˈfamily.  
Will you ˈget ˈfruit or ˈvegetables?  
ˈYes, but there's a ˈproblem.  
My ˈkids ˈdon't ˈlike ˈvegetables, and my ˈhusband ˈdoesn't ˈlike ˈfruit.  
So will you ˈget ˈfruit or ˈvegetables?  
I ˈthink I'll ˈget ˈboth: ˈapples, baˈnanas, ˈcarrots, and toˈmatoes.  
You ˈhave ˈtwo ˈkids, ˈdon't you?  
ˈYes. ˈTwo ˈboys.  
Iˈm ˈsure they ˈeat a ˈlot, ˈdon't they?  
ˈThat's for ˈsure. They ˈeat ˈmore than my ˈhusband does.  
ˈHow ˈoften do you ˈhave to ˈgo ˈshopping?  
About ˈtwice a ˈweek.  
Do you ˈusually ˈwalk to the ˈstore?  
ˈNo, I ˈusually ˈdrive to the ˈstore.  
ˈWell, ˈhere we are.  

Here it is again with the stress marks adjusted for better rhythm and meaning:

ˈGood ˈmorning, ˈSusan. ˈWhere are you ˈgoing?  
ˈHi, ˈMrs. ˈJones! I'm ˈgoing to the ˈstore.  
ˈI need to go, ˈtoo. Let's ˈgo toˈgether.  
ˈSounds ˈgood. Are you ˈbuying ˈfood?  
ˈYes. I ˈwant to get something ˈhealthy for my ˈfamily.  
Will you get ˈfruit or ˈvegetables?  
ˈYes, but there's a ˈproblem.  
My ˈkids don't like ˈvegetables, and my ˈhusband doesn't like ˈfruit.  
So will you get ˈfruit or ˈvegetables?  
I ˈthink I'll get ˈboth: ˈapples, baˈnanas, ˈcarrots, and toˈmatoes.  
You have ˈtwo kids, ˈdon't you?  
ˈYes. ˈTwo ˈboys.  
Iˈm ˈsure they ˈeat a ˈlot, ˈdon't they?  
ˈThat's for sure. ˈThey eat ˈmore than my ˈhusband does.  
How ˈoften do you ˈhave to go ˈshopping?  
About ˈtwice a ˈweek.  
Do you ˈusually ˈwalk to the ˈstore?  
ˈNo, I ˈusually ˈdrive to the ˈstore.  
ˈWell, ˈhere we ˈare.

## Word blending

As you have seen with contractions in the previous lesson, blending words together is common in English. Even in words that don't get contracted, there are many instances where the end of one word will join the start of the next word.

Word blending happens in the following situations:
1. **Consonant + Vowel**: One word ends with a consonant and the next word starts with a vowel
2. **Vowel + Vowel**: One word ends with a vowel and the next word also starts with a vowel
3. **Plosive consonant + Consonant**: One word ends with a plosive consonant (p, b, t, d, k, g) and the next word starts with a consonant
4. **Same sounds**: One word ends with the same sound that the next one begins with

You'll see examples of these below:

### Consonant + Vowel

The consonant and the vowel join together. Listen to the following examples:
- an apple
- come in
- speak English
- put on
- take out
- pick up
- all of us
- take it away
- keep it up

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/05/16-2.mp3" />

Note that the blending is according to sound, not spelling. "Come" ends with the consonant sound /m/ because the "e" is silent.

/j/ and /w/ are semi-vowels so if they begin the second word you can also treat them like vowels:
- have you
- splash yellow
- he's won
- then when

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/05/16-3.mp3" />

### Vowel + Vowel

The two vowels join together. Don't stop the air flowing or your voice sounding between them.
- go out
- my only
- how old
- see off
- may I
- who else
- the apple

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/05/16-4.mp3" />

Since /j/ and /w/ are semi-vowels, you can also blend them when they start the second word. (The *sounds* /j/ and /w/ never come at the end of a word in English.)
- who yelled
- go yonder
- see Wendy
- she won't

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/05/16-5.mp3" />

### Plosive Consonant + Consonant

When you have /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, or /g/ followed by another consonant, don't let out a breath of air after the plosive consonant. Instead, blend it into the next consonant.
- hit them
- deep down
- great deal
- silk purse
- dig down
- red shirt
- stop John
- fast train
- Bob Jones

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/05/16-6.mp3" />

### Same sounds

When one word ends with the same sound that the next one begins with, these are naturally blended. Rather than pronouncing the sound twice, you just say it once.
- wish she
- half frozen
- won nothing
- real letter
- Tom makes
- with those

### Student teacher examples

Here are some students reading some words that should be blended together.

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2020/05/blended-words-student-teacher-comparison.mp3" />

There is a pair of glasses on the desk.  
my only son  
all of us  
put it on  
take it away  
in August  
best of all  
more over  
far away  
go out  
too often  
look at it  
pick it up  
forever  
any other  
go on  
see off  
how old  
lamp glass  
pocket book  
great deal  
silk purse  
cardboard  
red card  
button*  
certain*  
what next  
park gate  
a red shirt  
a black jacket  
a fast train  
at night  

*These phrases come from the book 英语语音语调 by Zhang Guanlin and Sun Jingyuan.*

\* These words are not really word blending since they are only single words, but notice the glottal stop.

### Jokes

There is a genre of jokes where the author has a funny name based on the title of the book. Many of these have word blending as a part of the joke. Here are some examples:
- *Bad Falls* by Eileen Dover
- *A Stuntman To The End* by Kenny Doitt
- *Almost Missed the Bus* by Justin Time
- *Chest Pain* by I. Coffalot
- *Don't Tread On Me* by Amanda B. Reckonwith
- *How to Succeed in School* by Rita Book
- *I Hate the Sun* by Gladys Knight

### How to show word blending

You can show word blending by using an ‿ undertie character between the words that are blended.
- an‿apple
- go‿out
- hit‿them

### Practice

Find the likely places for word blending in the dialog:

Good morning, Susan. Where are you going?  
Hi, Mrs. Jones! I'm going to the store.  
I need to go, too. Let's go together.  
Sounds good. Are you buying food?  
Yes. I want to get something healthy for my family.  
Will you get fruit or vegetables?  
Yes, but there's a problem.  
My kids don't like vegetables, and my husband doesn't like fruit.  
So will you get fruit or vegetables?  
I think I'll get both: apples, bananas, carrots, and tomatoes.  
You have two kids, don't you?  
Yes. Two boys.  
I'm sure they eat a lot, don't they?  
That's for sure. They eat more than my husband does.  
How often do you have to go shopping?  
About twice a week.  
Do you usually walk to the store?  
No, I usually drive to the store.  
Well, here we are.  

### More practice

1. Listen to the imitation video at the start of this lesson again. Where is there word blending?
2. Find a written passage. Mark the locations where word blending is likely.
