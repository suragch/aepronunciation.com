## Plosive Consonants

Have you ever blown up a balloon until it pops?

That's a little like what plosive consonants are like. You can even see the ex**plos**ion in the word **plos**ive.

The plosive consonants are /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/.

Before we finish this lesson I want to teach you a few more pronunciation rules.

## The pronunciation of /p/, /t/, /k/ at the end of words

*Aspiration* means that you use the air from your lungs to make a sound. If a consonant is unaspirated then you just use the air in your mouth to make the sound.

#### /p/, /t/, /k/ are aspirated at the beginning of words

| /p/ | /t/ | /k/ |
|-----|-----|-----|
| pen | ten | Ken |
| pill | till | kill |
| pea | tea | key |

You should be able to feel the breath come out in a little burst when making these consonant sounds.

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-13.mp3" />

#### /p/, /t/, /k/ are unaspirated at the ends of words

| /p/ | /t/ | /k/ |
|-----|-----|-----|
| cap | feet | pick |
| rope | hot | back |
| cup | let | lock |

You shouldn't feel a puff of air or hear a hiss at the ends of these words.

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-14.mp3" />

## When are vowels short and when are they long?

You should have noticed that sometimes a vowel is long in American English and sometimes that same vowel is short. The difference is related to whether the consonant that comes after it is voiced or voiceless.

#### Vowels are long before a voiced consonant (b, d, g, ʤ, v, ð, z, ʒ, m, n, ŋ, l)

- cob
- odd
- pig
- judge
- save
- bathe
- has
- beige
- mom
- ton
- sang
- fill

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-15.mp3" />

#### Vowels are short before a voiceless consonant (p, t, k, ʧ, f, θ, s, ʃ)

- heap
- hot
- back
- latch
- laugh
- bath
- base
- fish

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-16.mp3" />

#### Comparison

- lab – lap
- feed – feet
- dog – dock
- age – "H"
- prove – proof
- clothe – cloth
- close – close
- massage, Josh

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-17.mp3" />

## The many sounds of "t"

The letter "t" seems like such a simple letter. It just says /t/, right? Wrong. The letter "t" has at least five sounds in American English.

#### 1. Aspirated t

The letter "t" is aspirated at the beginning of words and stressed syllables.

- two
- tie
- toe
- telephone
- attend
- attack
- Italian
- photography

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-18.mp3" />

#### 2. Unaspirated t

The letter t is not aspirated at the end of words:

- it
- bite
- note
- hot
- what

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-19.mp3" />

It's also unaspirated after the letter "s":

- stop
- store
- stand
- astounding

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-20.mp3" />

#### 3. Flap t

This is the phoneme /ɾ/. It sounds almost like a very fast /d/ sound.

It happens in American English when the letter "t" comes between vowels (and some consonants) in an unstressed syllable.

- water
- little
- matter
- daughter
- put on
- writer
- bottom
- a lot of
- thirty
- forty
- about her

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-21.mp3" />

#### 4. Glottal stop

This is the phoneme /ʔ/. You hear this sound in the middle of the the word uh-oh.

You often get a glottal stop when the letter "t" is after a vowel (or "r") and before the /n/ sound.

- button
- fountain
- partner
- written
- kitten
- forgotten

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-22.mp3" />

You also get it when "t" is after a vowel (or "r") and before a consonant.

- apartment
- might be
- white goose
- it walks

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-23.mp3" />

Many times (but not always) speakers will use it before a pause.

- Stop it!
- I might be late.
- Look at that.

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-24.mp3" />

#### 5. Silent t

The letter "t" is often omitted when it comes after "n" and before a vowel (or "r" or "l").

- center
- advantage
- winter

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-25.mp3" />

It's also omitted when it occurs between consonants:

- acts
- accepts
- fast pig
- walked slowly
- correctly

<AudioPlayer src="/uploads/2021/03/6-26.mp3" />

## Homework

Practice at least 50 Double sounds (vowels and consonants). You can select those in the settings.
